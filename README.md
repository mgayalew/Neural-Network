## Predicted handwritten numbers using neural network
The aim was to predict handwritten numbers using neural network technique. A 5,000 by 401 pixel of handwritten data was provided. I used a neural network structure with three layers (with layer size of 400, 25, 10 ). The cost function and gradient of neural network was written and the weight was predicted using fmincg Octave algorithm.
