# Neural-Network
## Predicted handwritten numbers using neural network
The aim is to predict handwritten numbers using neural network technique. A 5,000 by 401 pixel of handwritten data is provided. A neural network structure with three layers (with layer size of 400, 25, 10 )is used. The cost function and gradient of neural network is written and the weight is predicted using fmincg Octave algorithm. Running the file "ex4.m" will give us the prediction.
